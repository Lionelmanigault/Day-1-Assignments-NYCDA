		<h1>Who owns the 2015 Billboard Awards</h1>
			<p>In a night that belonged to Taylor Swift, she hit her highest note at Sunday's iHeartRadio Awards alongside new BFF Madonna. Swift made a surprise appearance to provide guitar accompaniment for Madonna's performance of "Ghosttown," the new single from Rebel Heart and the awards show's best performance.</p>

			<p>The alluring, post-apocalyptic song could well shape up to be a hit for Madonna, and she and Swift shared the stage with the ease of kindred spirits. Later in the night, Madonna presented Swift with the song of the year award for "Shake It Off," and Swift thanked "Madonna for being Madonna."</p>

			<p>Justin Timberlake was honored with the innovator award and took the opportunity to quote both Steve Jobs and Theodore Roosevelt in his acceptance speech. He also had some inspiring words for young fans, telling them when he was in school he was called weird or different, "never an innovator." He thanked his mom for teaching him being different was a good thing.</p>

			<p>Jeremih told Billboard on site at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles that he's been busy working on his new album, which will be out soon. "I'm about to go on tour with J. Cole, Big Sean with YG, and I wouldn't do that without putting out a body of work. It's been almost five years since I released my last album. I've been working with so many other people I really haven't focused on myself, but luckily I was still able to maintain what it do."</p>
