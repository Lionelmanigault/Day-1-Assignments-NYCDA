		<h1>What's the difference between cats?</h1>
			<p><b>Leopards</b> and <b>Jaguars</b> are two distinct species, but they are similar:the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but is smaller and more slightly built. Its fur is marked with rosettes similar to those of the jaguar, but the leopard's rosettes are smaller and more densely packed, and do not usually have central spots as the jaguars do.</p>

			<p><b>Cheetahs</b> are in the felidae family and the only member of the acinonyx genus. Cheetahs have solid spots versus a rosette pattern for a leopard. Cheetah's have longer legs and a longer tail. Leopards are much more solid and heavy. Cheetahs are the fastest land animals in the world, able to run up to 75 mph in short bursts, and accelerate from 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. The cheetah in this pic is below.</p>

			<p><b>Cougars</b> are also members of the Felidae family and they are also a distinct species. They belong to the puma genus. Alternative terms for cougar include <i>puma, mountain lion, mountain cat, catamount</i>. Unlike leopards, cougars typically don't have spots, and they are also smaller than leopards. Genetically, they're also more related to domestic cats than the four big cats.</p>

			<p><b>Panther</b> is a versatile word that can refer to different leopards, jaguars, or mountain lions. It usually refers to a melanistic or black cat. That's why the phrase "black panther" is common. In Africa and Asia, panther refers to leopards. In North America, it refers to mountain lion. In South America, it refers to jaguars.</p>
